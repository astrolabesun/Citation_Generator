# Citation_Generator
This project is a personal project started out of the fact that I do not want to pay to get a citation generated for me,
but at the same time I wanted to be able to create citations quickly. This is going to be coded in Python on the Django
framework, which inside the citationapp folders has templates that can create usable views, although that is still
in progress. 


## Status
Basic Configuration of urls, views, general set up of Django. Soon going to set up proper views when the
templates are ready.
